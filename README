This is the repository I used with "How the Heck Do I Use Github". I think it helped me quite a bit.
Learning the cmd pathway was cool but I'm not sure if I'm using Github correctly.
Is it supposed to display and run the code I create?
Or is it simply a place where I can throw my code so that others can help me.
  I am guessing that it is this option.
I added a small project that I threw together on ATOM a few months ago that I know 'works' to see the functionality.
Cool.
